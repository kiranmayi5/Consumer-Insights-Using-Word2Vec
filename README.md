This academic project involved applying Word2Vec to a dataset of product reviews from a popular e-commerce platform specializing in cosmetic products. The goal was to extract meaningful insights from consumer feedback and identify trends that could guide strategic decisions in product development and marketing.

Project Overview:

- Dataset: The analysis used detailed product reviews from the Nykaa platform, including information such as product ratings, review content, and brand details.
- Word2Vec Modeling: Built Word2Vec models in Python to create word vectors from the review data, capturing semantic relationships between words.
- Visualization: Used TensorFlowâ€™s projector to visualize word clusters and uncover insights such as commonly associated product terms, consumer preferences, and emerging trends in the cosmetic industry.
- Knowledge Discovery: Analyzed word vector clusters to understand key consumer concerns and preferences, including the relationship between products like concealer and foundation, preferred product finishes, and specific skin concerns addressed by the reviews.
